**icare** is an open source [carpooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpool) platform used as a basis for our commercial product [Company Carpool](https://www.companycarpool.com).

Carpooling (also known as car-sharing, ride-sharing, lift-sharing and covoiturage), is the sharing of car journeys so that more than one person travels in a car.
By having more people using one vehicle, carpooling reduces each personâ€™s travel costs such as fuel costs, tolls, and the stress of driving. Carpooling is also seen as a more environmentally friendly and sustainable way to travel as sharing journeys reduces carbon emissions, traffic congestion on the roads, and the need for parking spaces. Authorities often encourage carpooling, especially during high pollution periods and high fuel prices. (From Wikipedia).

**icare** uses the following technologies:

* [Ruby on Rails][:rails_url]
* [PostgreSQL][:postgresql]
* [Shakapacker][:shakapacker_url]
* [Handlebars.js][:handlebarsjs_url] (JavaScript semantic templates)
* [SLIM][:slim_url]
* [Bootstrap][:bootstrap_url]
* [Font Awesome][:fa_url] (vectorial icons)
* [Devise][:devise_url]
* Asynchronous tasks with [Sucker Punch][:sucker_punch_url]
* OAuth login with [Auth0][:auth0_url]
* Google Maps API
* [RSpec][:rspec_url]
* [Heroku][:heroku_url] Cloud Application Platform
* [Multi-Environment configuration][:simpleconfig_url]
* [Airbrake][:airbrake_url] Exception Notification
* [New Relic][:newrelic_url] Application Performance Management service

Generate SSL requirements:

```ssh
openssl req -subj '/CN=localhost' -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout docker/nginx/ssl/app_key.pem -out docker/nginx/ssl/app_cert.pem -days 825
openssl genpkey -genparam -algorithm DH -out docker/nginx/ssl/app_dhparam4096.pem -pkeyopt dh_paramgen_prime_len:4096
```

Copy `docker/icare/variables.env.example` to `docker/icare/variables.env` and
run `docker compose up`

icare will be accessible on `https://localhost:3443`

### Start Rails outside of Docker with SSL

After generating the SSL requirements, run:

```sh
rails s -b "ssl://0.0.0.0:3443?key=docker/nginx/ssl/app_key.pem&cert=docker/nginx/ssl/app_cert.pem"
```

icare will be accessible on `https://localhost:3443`
